      <strong> Roadblocks </strong> 
      <br>
        All team members are now able to run the app locally, including local database. While we've integrated Google Analytics, the referral stream does not yet differentiate between sources of traffic.

    <div>
      <h2>Product Backlog</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>List events on home page (<strong>18 story points</strong>)</li>

        <li>Set up Cloud9 infrastructure (<strong>5 story points</strong>)</li>
      </ol>
       <p>
       Next week we we will work on as many story points as we can on our assigned stories. On 
       returning to SOM, we will go to office hours to resolve roadblocks.

75% of work done is documented on trello. 10% on fixing bugs on model and create registrant database. 5% on building out insertion of data into events database 

I was up for a long time but couldn’t get the database talking to the app: It’s running in dev mode and I can add events to it manually in Postgres but not through the app. Luckily I think the problem is well defined and I’m going to go see Kyle at 9:50 to get his help. If this is fixed I think I‘ll be able to fix not just the index page but also the event detail page

Also in the process I found some hiccups in our schema.sql which I commented out when pushing to master. Not sure if they were causing issues for you guys as well, but in case you pull from master this morning and run into problems you can revert the changes I made to schema.sql

The index page now successfully pulls the list of events from the events database AND the event creation page successfully adds events to the database! At least on my local machine lol
