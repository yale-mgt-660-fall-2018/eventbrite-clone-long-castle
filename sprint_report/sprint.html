      <h2>Burndown chart</h2>
      <p>
      Because many of the tasks we worked on this week were foundational in nature, we didn’t prepare a burndown chart. 
      In lieu of a burndown chart, this is our Trello-based project management system. 
      Our subsequent sprint reports will include proper burndown charts.

      <h2>Sprint Completed Stories</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Set up Kanban board</li>
        <li>Deploy starter code locally (screenshot included below)</li>
        <li>Deploy starter code on Heroku at <a href="https://eventbrite-clone-long-castle.herokuapp.com">https://eventbrite-clone-long-castle.herokuapp.com</a></li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      Our team worked on setting up a project management system within Trello, and worked on understanding the functionality of the starter code. We divided up agile roles within our team, and identified a PO and a Scrum Master. We worked on estimating story points, for which we used the number of tests as a benchmark.
